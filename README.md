Pygame-RTS is an open source real time strategy game engine made using pygame and runs in python.

Features

Base Building & Economy: Construct headquarters, barracks, factories, power plants, and resource extractors (e.g., Oil Derricks, Refineries). Manage credits and power to expand your empire.

Unit Production & Combat: Train infantry, tanks, helicopters, and more. Units auto-target enemies with projectile-based combat, chase mechanics, and formation movement.

AI Opponents: Up to 7 AI players with randomized personalities (aggressive, defensive, rusher, balanced). They build, produce, scout, and attack dynamically.

Game Modes: 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, or 4-player Free-for-All (FFA). Spectator mode available.

Maps & Terrain: 4 biomes (Desert, Forest, Ice, Urban) with scalable sizes (Tiny to Huge). Procedural terrain generation with craters and fog of war.

UI & Controls: Minimap, production sidebar, selection boxes, rally points, and health bars. Smooth camera panning/zooming.

Effects: Explosions, plasma burns, trailing projectiles, and unit/building sprites drawn with Pygame primitives.

Performance: Spatial hashing for efficient queries, multithreaded unit updates, and cleanup for dead entities.
